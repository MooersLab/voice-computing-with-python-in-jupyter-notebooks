# Slides for PyTexas 2024 talk: Voice Computing with Python in Jupyter Notebooks

The annual [PyTexas meeting](https://www.pytexas.org/2024/) is a regional meeting that has been running since 2007.
It is associated with the very active monthly PyTexas meetup.
They let people from outside of Texas participate.
Volunteers run the meeting; they spend the prior year working hard to organize it.

There were 18 speakers from around the United States.
There were also additional attendees from all around the United States.
There was a large contingent from Bloomberg in NYC.

There were over 200 people in attendance.
The first day had two great tutorial sessions.
The second and third days had excellent talks.
There were terrific lightning talks at the end of each day.
The talks were recorded and will eventually appear on the [PyTexas YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@PyTexas/playlists).
The meeting organizers did a fantastic job!

This repository contains the slides and three narrated videos that provided coding demonstrations and were used with the slides for a talk about using voice computing in Jupyter.
The demo of voice computing in a markdown cell received applause. 
This is the first time that I have received applause in the middle of a talk.

## Installation

- git clone the repo. The slides will be expecting the `videos` subdirectory to be present.
- Open the PDF in Adobe Reader.
- I used QuickTime on a Mac to run the videos.
- These videos open in `QuickTime\ Player.app` when you click on the center of the slides with **Demo** in the title.
